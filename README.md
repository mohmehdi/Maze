**university project** 
maze generator and DFS algorithem with unity.  
generator is not that great  

# Use

to test this u will need unity 2018.3 .
you can make a maze by editing text file here >>((inside Maze\\Assets\\Input\\way.txt"))\
**and also**\
**remeber to change the way.txt path in maze script**


### Installing

I have no idea 

## Running the tests
i used gizmoes to show maze so enable gizmoes in game window .

select one of use input or make maze options and run it simple enough :wink:	 ;)
you can change scripts properties for example:  
mouse.sc has timebtwupdateds field : decreese it to make it faster.
